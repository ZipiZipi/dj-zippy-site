                    <p>Stepping onto the stage at Exit is always a surreal experience. The energy from the crowd is palpable long before the first track is even queued up. This year was no different. Playing the early evening slot on the main stage was an honor, and the response from everyone who came out to dance was incredible.</p>
                    <p>My goal for this set was to build a journey. Starting with some deep, melodic house to match the sunset vibe, and slowly ramping up the tempo and energy as night fell. Seeing the crowd follow along, with hands in the air during the key drops, is a feeling that never gets old. It's a connection, a shared moment that's bigger than just the music.</p>

                    <h3>Key Tracks That Landed</h3>
                    <p>A few tracks really seemed to resonate with everyone. The new release from [Artist Name] was a definite highlight, and dropping my unreleased edit of [Classic Track] got a huge reaction. It's moments like those that I DJ for.</p>
                    <p>Thank you to the Exit Festival organizers for having me, and most importantly, thank you to every single person who danced, cheered, and shared their energy. You are the reason these nights are so special. Can't wait to see you all again next year.</p>
